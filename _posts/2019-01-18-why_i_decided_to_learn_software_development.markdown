I was oblivious about the internet until my late teens after having recently moved from Nigeria to the USA. In spite of the two decades that have gone by, I still recall vividly, exactly where i was when i read about the internet  (or "The Information Highway" as it was referred to in that local newspaper clipping) for the first time. I could not at the time, wrap my head around the idea of an internet, how it worked or what possibilities it held. The Nigeria I left behind in the late ninties was the pre cellphone  version where the land line telephone was still dominant, all be it a luxury only a select few in society could afford.  

My first encounter with the internet was  at the local community college where I had enrolled to take a course my first summer in the USA. To me it was a profound experience and  it's held my fascination until today. I like to think of a person with the ability to develop software like a person who posesses an ability similar to a superpower, one which allows you create virtually any idea from the ether. I knew from that first encounter that I would eventually, some day in the future figure out how to work alongside, and indeed be counted amongst the incredible people who bring ideas to life, line of code after line of code. No matter what it took or how long it took, I would one day work alongside these talented folk.
