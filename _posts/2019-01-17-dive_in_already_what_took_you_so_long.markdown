I knew shortly after I started my new job right out of college that something was missing. It was obvious to me that I enjoyed building websites and working on adobe photoshop or illusterator projects way more than sizing rebar and anchor bolts. Why then did i persevere through a 10 year slog as a structural engineer? Although I have contemplated this question for quite a while now, a coherent explanation for my decision still eludes me. 

I finally made the jump in the late summer of 2017. Well, to be honest, while i did quit my full time engineering job, I didn't quite dive right into the flatiron school's program right away and  I regret my indecisiveness till this day. I had dwaddled and dabbled in the prework for months on end, somehow believing I wasn't capable of keeping up, talk less of excelling at the full time program. Additionally (& regretfully), I had detoured and had flirted with d3.js and data visualization, had gotten stuck, had tried to work through some books and finally, with exaspiration, when every semblance of progress had seemingly ground to a halt, I resolved to dive right in. I had failed to heed obviously sound advice i'd gleaned on the internet  and everywhere else really, they all in some fashion espoused sticking with one clear learning path coupled with writing code consistently. 

well, fast forward to about a year and a half  into my misadventure and I'm finally working through the full stack community-powered online bootcamp program and might I say, why on earth did i wait so long to get started? I am learning a lot and savoring the journey as best as I can. My confidence is steadily growing as i tackle new challenges daily. I am learning a lot more about myself. A few (very rare)times I've even impressed myself by uncovering erstwhile dormant abilities like resourcefulness and the ability to persevere through seemingly unsolvable code challenges. Days like these reaffirm my belief that I have chosen a very tenable path and what's more? I do appear to be enjoying the process on a very genuiune level.
